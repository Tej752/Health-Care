Predict Health Insurance Owners' who will be interested in Vehicle Insurance

MedCamp organizes health camps in several cities with low work-life balance. They reach out to working people and ask them to register for these health camps. For those who attend, MedCamp provides them the facility to undergo health checks or increase awareness by visiting various stalls

MedCamp has conducted 65 such events over a period of 4 years and they see a high drop off between “Registration” and the Number of people taking tests at the Camps. In the last 4 years, they have stored data of ~110,000 registrations they have done.

One of the huge costs in arranging these camps is the amount of inventory you need to carry. If you carry more than the required inventory, you incur unnecessarily high costs. On the other hand, if you carry less than the required inventory for conducting these medical checks, people end up having bab experience.

The Process:
MedCamp employees/volunteers reach out to people and drive registrations.
During the camp, People who “ShowUp” either undergo the medical tests or visit stalls depending on the format of the health camp.
Other things to note:
Since this is a completely voluntary activity for the working professionals, MedCamp usually has little profile information about these people.
For a few camps, there was a hardware failure, so some information about the date and time of registration is lost.
MedCamp runs 3 formats of these camps. The first and second format provides people with an instantaneous health score. The third format provides information about several health issues through various awareness stalls.
Favorable outcome:
For the first 2 formats, a favorable outcome is defined as getting a health_score, while in the third format it is defined as visiting at least a stall.
You need to predict the chances (probability) of having a favorable outcome.
